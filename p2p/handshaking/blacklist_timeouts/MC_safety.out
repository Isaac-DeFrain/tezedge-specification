Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-04-17 00:38:53.
Progress(17) at 2021-04-17 00:39:01: 9,418,670 states generated (9,418,670 s/min), 707,410 distinct states found (707,410 ds/min), 170,685 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.7E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 4.3E-7
31207195 states generated, 1686451 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 29.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 14 and the 95th percentile is 3).

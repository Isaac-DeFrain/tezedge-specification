Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-04-20 01:22:35.
Progress(16) at 2021-04-20 01:22:43: 7,782,455 states generated (7,782,455 s/min), 678,479 distinct states found (678,479 ds/min), 227,964 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.1E-5
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 8.3E-7
64276179 states generated, 3389508 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 32.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 14 and the 95th percentile is 4).

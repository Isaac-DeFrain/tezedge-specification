# tezedge-specification

Various specifications and models for different aspects of the Tezedge node's p2p overlay network, shell, and consensus.

## Tools

### Apalache

[Apalache](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache) is used extensively in this project to typecheck specifications and verify inductive (safety) invariants (see [Apalache docs](https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/apalache/index.html)). The easiest way to get and run Apalache is through [docker](https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/apalache/installation/docker.html):

Pull the `unstable` image:

```
docker pull apalache/mc:unstable
```

Set an alias for the `unstable` image (if you're using Linux or macOS):

```
$ alias apalache='docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/var/apalache apalache/mc:unstable'
```

Specific instructions to verify inductive invariants are provided in the corresponding spec's directory.

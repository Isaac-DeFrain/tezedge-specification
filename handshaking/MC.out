Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 10 branches.
Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-03-13 01:44:00.
Progress(21) at 2021-03-13 01:44:05: 5,268 states generated, 1,641 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 10 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 16410 total distinct states at (2021-03-13 01:44:05)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2021-03-13 01:44:05
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.2E-13
5268 states generated, 1641 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 21.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 6 and the 95th percentile is 3).

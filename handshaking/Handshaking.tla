CONSTANTS
    NODES, \* set of nodes in the network
    MIN,   \* minimum number of connections
    MAX    \* maximum number of connections

VARIABLES
    connect,     \* tuple of nodes to make a connection with
    connections, \* tuple of each node's connections
    messages,    \* tuple of each node's incoming messages
    waiting      \* tuple of nodes each node is waiting for a response from

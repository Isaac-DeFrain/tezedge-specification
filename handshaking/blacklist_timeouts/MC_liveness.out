Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.7E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.6E-7
31207195 states generated, 1686451 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 30.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 15 and the 95th percentile is 4).

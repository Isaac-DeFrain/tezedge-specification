Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-04-12 00:32:00.
Progress(17) at 2021-04-12 00:32:07: 4,127,078 states generated (4,127,078 s/min), 517,141 distinct states found (517,141 ds/min), 194,096 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.2E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.0E-7
22155025 states generated, 1991532 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 31.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 14 and the 95th percentile is 3).
